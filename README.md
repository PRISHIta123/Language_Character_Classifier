# Language_Character_Classifier
A React web Application that allows a user to select a language, and draw a character belonging to that language on the React Canvas. The drawing is saved as a file blob on the React client and downloaded locally, that passes it to a flask server running a Python Classifier Script using TensorFlow. The final result includes the top 5 predicted characters of the selected language being displayed to the user.
